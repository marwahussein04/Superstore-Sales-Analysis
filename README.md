# Superstore-Sales-Analysis
This project explores regional variations in consumer purchasing patterns across the U.S., focusing on urban vs. rural areas and east vs. west regions. Using sales transaction data (2015â€“2018) from a major retail superstore, the analysis aims to provide actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies and product offerings.
